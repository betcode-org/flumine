# Advanced

## Flumine

Functions:

- `add_client` Adds a [client](/advanced/#clients) to the framework
- `add_strategy` Adds a [strategy](/advanced/#strategies) to the framework
- `add_worker` Adds a [worker](/advanced/#background-workers) to the framework
- `add_client_control` Adds a [client control](/advanced/#client-controls) to the framework
- `add_trading_control` Adds a [trading control](/advanced/#trading-controls) to the framework
- `add_market_middleware` Adds [market middleware](/markets/#middleware) to the framework
- `add_logging_control` Adds a [logging control](/advanced/#logging-controls) to the framework

The Flumine class can be adapted by overriding the following functions:

- `_process_market_books()` called on MarketBook event
- `_process_sports_data()` called on SportsData event
- `_process_market_orders()` called when market has pending orders
- `_process_order_package()` called on new OrderPackage
- `_add_market()` called when new Market received through streams
- `_remove_market()` called when Market removed from framework
- `_process_raw_data()` called on RawData event
- `_process_market_catalogues` called on MarketCatalogue event
- `_process_current_orders` called on currentOrders event
- `_process_custom_event` called on CustomEvent event see [here](/advanced/#custom-event)
- `_process_close_market` called on Market closure
- `_process_cleared_orders()` called on ClearedOrders event
- `_process_cleared_markets()` called on ClearedMarkets event
- `_process_end_flumine()` called on Flumine termination

## Streams

### Market Stream

Flumine handles market streams by taking the parameters provided in the strategies, a strategy will then subscribe to the stream. This means strategies can share streams reducing load or create new if they require different markets or data filter.

### Data Stream

Similar to Market Streams but the raw streaming data is passed back, this reduces ram/CPU and allows recording of the data for future playback, see the example marketrecorder.py

### Historical Stream

This is created on a per market basis when simulating.

### Order Stream

Subscribes to all orders per running instance using the `config.customer_strategy_ref`

## Custom Streams

Custom streams (aka threads) can be added as per:

```python
from flumine.streams.basestream import BaseStream
from flumine.events.events import CustomEvent


class CustomStream(BaseStream):
    def run(self) -> None:
        # connect to stream / make API requests etc.
        response = api_call()

        # callback func
        def callback(framework, event):
            for strategy in framework.strategies:
                strategy.process_my_event(event)

        # push results through using custom event
        event = CustomEvent(response, callback)

        # put in main queue
        self.flumine.handler_queue.put(event)


custom_stream = CustomStream(framework, custom=True)
framework.streams.add_custom_stream(custom_stream)
```


## Error Handling

Flumine will catch all errors that occur in `strategy.check_market` and `strategy.process_market_book`, and log either error or critical errors.

!!! tip
    You can remove this error handling by setting `config.raise_errors = True`

## Logging

jsonlogger is used to log extra detail, see below for a typical setup:

```python
import time
import logging
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger

logger = logging.getLogger()

custom_format = "%(asctime) %(levelname) %(message)"
log_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter(custom_format)
formatter.converter = time.gmtime
log_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(log_handler)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

## Config

#### simulated

Updated to True when simulating or paper trading

#### simulated_strategy_isolation

Defaults to True to match orders per strategy, when False prevents double counting of passive liquidity on all orders regardless of strategy.

#### simulation_available_prices

When True will simulate matches against available prices after initial execution, note this will double count liquidity.

#### instance_id

Store server id or similar (e.g. AWS ec2 instanceId)

#### customer_strategy_ref / hostname

Used as customerStrategyRefs so that only orders created by the running instance are returned.

#### process_id

OS process id of running application.

#### current_time

Used for simulation

#### raise_errors

Raises errors on strategy functions, see [Error Handling](/advanced/#error-handling)

#### max_execution_workers

Max number of workers in execution thread pool

#### async_place_orders

Place orders sent with place orders flag, prevents waiting for bet delay

#### place_latency

Place latency used for simulation / simulation execution

#### cancel_latency

Cancel latency used for simulation / simulation execution

#### update_latency

Update latency used for simulation / simulation execution

#### replace_latency

Replace latency used for simulation / simulation execution

#### order_sep 

customer_order_ref separator

#### execution_retry_attempts

Cancel attempts when the OrderStream is not connected
